Motivation
========================================================

### <u>Mainstream practices in current research</u>

- Data sources not published
- Source code not published
- Experiments are literaly depicted
  - thus, almost imposible to reproduce
- Reproducing usualy takes same amount of time (or more) than performing the original research
- That slows down dramaticaly the advance of science


Top Ten Reasons To Not Share Your Code
========================================================
<small>By <i>Randall J. LeVeque</i>

1. The proof is too ugly to show anyone else
2. I didn't work out all the details
3. I didn't actually prove the theorem---my student did
4. Giving the proof to my competitors would be unfair to me
5. The proof is valuable intellectual property
6. Including proofs would make math papers much longer
7. Referees would never agree to check proofs
8. The proof uses sophisticated mathematical machinery that most readers/referees don't know
9. My proof invokes other theorems with unpublished (proprietary) proofs
10. Readers who have access to my proof will want user support

Researchers nowadays are always in a rush
========================================================

### Leading to dubious methods: <small>
- Case selection
  - Maximizing method performance
- Data selection (idem)
- The method only works on toy problems
- Proofs are faulty (just slightly **:)**)
- The code is...
  - Dirty
  - Unreadable
  - Not tested/fault-prone
- Simply don't want to share my data/code **It's my treausure!!**
</small>

Why should I share my efforts then?
